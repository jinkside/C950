# pyPacks
This repository contains an application that was a school project. It's intended to be a simplified package routing system for a theoretical shipping company.

This is in development, so please see the commit history for current status.

"pyPacks" is the Python implementation of my solution, and I wanted to leave room for solutions in other languages in case I had time to explore that.

If you're working on C950, the evaluators probably won't appreciate you using code from this repository... or any other.
